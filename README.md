# Kameleon-lampe-prosjekt
I'm using a Arduino Nano bought from eBay, which often means you have to install a different compiler/device.

Components:
- Arduino Nano
- Common kathode RGB LEDs
- Transistors
- Resistors
- Photocell/photoresistor

Note to self:
- Make .gitignore
- Make complete component list
