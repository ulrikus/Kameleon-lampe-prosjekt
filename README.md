I'm using a Arduino Nano bought from eBay, which often means you have to install a different serial to USB driver (CH340G). Follow the steps in the tutorial found on this link: 
http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-fix-bad-Chinese-Arduino-clones/

Download the software from the manufactor from the following link:

Components:
- Arduino Nano
- Common kathode RGB LEDs
- Transistors (2N3904)
- Resistors
- Photocell/photoresistor

Note to self:
- Make .gitignore
- Make complete component list
